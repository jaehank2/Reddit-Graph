## Summary ##
Our final project uses the [Stanford Reddit Hyperlink Network dataset](http://snap.stanford.edu/data/soc-RedditHyperlinks.html) to provide intresting insights about interactions and conflicts between communities called subreddits on the popular website [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com).

## Data Cleaning ##
The raw data is in a TSV (Tab Seperated Values) format where each line represents a link (see example below). To format this data to our desired format we used python scripts that can be found in the [Python Files](https://github-dev.cs.illinois.edu/cs225-fa20/yashg3-adish2-jaehank2-dcl3/tree/master/Python%20Files) folder.

Source Subreddit | Target Subreddit | POST ID | Timestamp           | Sentiment | Post Properties
-----------------|------------------|---------|---------------------|-----------|-----------------
leagueoflegends  | teamredditteams  | 1u4nrps | 2013-12-31 16:39:58 | 1         | 345.0,298.0,... 

For our analysis we decided to to only keep the Source and Target subreddits which would be vertices in our graph and the link sentiment which would represent the edgeweight of the edge connecting these subreddits. To do this we wrote a python script - [cleaner.py](https://github-dev.cs.illinois.edu/cs225-fa20/yashg3-adish2-jaehank2-dcl3/blob/master/Python%20Files/cleaner.py) - which loads the tsv file into a Pandas Dataframe and drops all unwanted information for each link. The raw data also has multiedges - multiple links connecting the same two edges - whose sentiment is added up and the number of multiedges is counted, this cleaned data was then exported to a file called [cleaned.csv](https://github-dev.cs.illinois.edu/cs225-fa20/yashg3-adish2-jaehank2-dcl3/blob/master/data/cleaned.csv) with the following format:

Source Subreddit | Target Subreddit | Sentiment | Count
-----------------|------------------|-----------|-------
leagueoflegends  | teamredditteams  | 1         | 7 

We also wanted to ensure out graph didnt have disconnected vertices. To ensure this we wrote another python script - [cleaner2.py](https://github-dev.cs.illinois.edu/cs225-fa20/yashg3-adish2-jaehank2-dcl3/blob/master/Python%20Files/cleaner2.py) - which loads [cleaned.csv](https://github-dev.cs.illinois.edu/cs225-fa20/yashg3-adish2-jaehank2-dcl3/blob/master/data/cleaned.csv), drops any vertices that arent connected to the larget connected component of the graph using the [NetworkX](https://networkx.org/) library, and saves it to [connected.csv](https://github-dev.cs.illinois.edu/cs225-fa20/yashg3-adish2-jaehank2-dcl3/blob/master/data/connected.csv). This reduces the number of vertices in the dataset from 55,863 to 52,468.

Now our data has no disconnected components, no multiedges and is in the desired format:
Source Subreddit | Target Subreddit | Sentiment | Count
-----------------|------------------|-----------|------- 

### Steps to fomat data: ###
1. Ensure source tsv file "soc-redditHyperlinks-title.tsv" is in the [data](https://github-dev.cs.illinois.edu/cs225-fa20/yashg3-adish2-jaehank2-dcl3/tree/master/data) directory.
2. Change to the [Python Files](https://github-dev.cs.illinois.edu/cs225-fa20/yashg3-adish2-jaehank2-dcl3/tree/master/Python%20Files) directory using `cd "Python Files"`
3. Ensure all python dependencies are installed using `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Run [cleaner.py](https://github-dev.cs.illinois.edu/cs225-fa20/yashg3-adish2-jaehank2-dcl3/blob/master/Python%20Files/cleaner.py) using `python cleaner.py`
5. Run [cleaner2.py](https://github-dev.cs.illinois.edu/cs225-fa20/yashg3-adish2-jaehank2-dcl3/blob/master/Python%20Files/cleaner2.py) using `python cleaner2.py`

## Executables ##
### For users: ###
